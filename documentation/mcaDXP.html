The DXP-4 is a Digital Signal Processor based multichannel analyzer from X-ray
Instrumentation Associates.  It is a single-width CAMAC module with up to 4
input channels.  Each channel contains the equivalent electronics of the
shaping amplifier, ADC and MCA of a
conventional pulse-height analysis system.

Support for the DXP-4 under EPICS is provided in the following manner:

This permits each channel of the DXP-4 to
be connected to an MCA record identically with other supported MCA hardware,
including the Canberra AIM.

selectable parameters for the DXP, including shaping times, pileup rejection
criteria, etc.
